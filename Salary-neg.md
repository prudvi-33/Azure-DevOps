**💡 HR: What are your salary expectations?** <br/>
🚀 You: <br/>
"I’m looking for a competitive salary that aligns with my experience, DevOps skills, <br/>
and market standards. May I know the budget companyname has allocated for this role?" <br/>

===================================================

**🔹 If HR Insists on a Number
💡 HR: We need a number to proceed.** <br/>
🚀 You: <br/>
"I understand. Based on my research and industry standards for similar DevOps roles, <br/>
I was expecting around ₹14 LPA. However, I’m open to discussing it further to find a mutually beneficial agreement." <br/>

**planB** <br/>

I was expecting salary in the range of 14-16LPA. I feel that is an accurate and fair representation of what my skills are, and what I bring value to the table, <br/>
especially what you are looking for this role. I feel that's a fair ask. <br/>

==================================

**If HR Says "Our Budget is ₹12LPA"** <br/>

"I appreciate that. However, considering my skills in Azure, <br/>
Kubernetes, CI/CD automation, and my quick joining, a package closer to ₹14 LPA would be more aligned with the market and my expertise. Can we bridge the gap?" <br/>

==================================

 How to Respond If **HR Says "Your Current is 5.2 LPA, So We Can Only Offer 12 LPA"** <br/>
💡 **HR: Your current salary is 5.2 LPA, so we can offer up to 12 LPA. <br/>**

🚀 You:
"I understand that you're considering my current salary, but my move is based on the value I bring rather than just a percentage hike. Over the past few years, <br/>
I have gained strong expertise in DevOps, Azure, Kubernetes, CI/CD automation, and cloud technologies, which are highly in demand." <br/>

"Given my experience and immediate availability, I was expecting something closer to 14 LPA as a fixed salary to reflect market standards. <br/>
and I’d appreciate it if we could align closer to ₹14 LPA. Is there flexibility to align it better?" <br/>

**Enhance: with PlanB** <br/>

mmm, but at this point, I think its slightly lower than what I was expecting, Can we workout a way? <br/>

====================================================================================================
**If HR Still Insists on 12 LPA** <br/>

"I appreciate the offer, and I truly see potential in joining Capgemini. However, for someone with my DevOps expertise and quick onboarding, <br/>
I’ve seen similar roles in the market offering 14 LPA or higher." <br/>

"Would it be possible to reconsider the offer or explore alternatives, such as a performance-based increment, a retention bonus, or a joining incentive?"<br/>


Main ============================== **"I’d love to finalize this and move forward, so I’d appreciate if we can work something out."** <br/> ==========================

Main ============================== **explain about offer at last,** <br/> ====================================

**If HR Asks, "What’s Your Other Offer?"** <br/>
💡 **HR: Can you share the offer details? Has it been released?** <br/>

🚀 You (Smart Response):
"I’m currently in the final stages of discussions with another company, and they have indicated an offer in the range of ₹14-15 LPA. <br/>
However, I like the problem that you are solving and I'd much rather be here, and I see myself as <br/>
being here for long run and have a strong interest in Capgemini , So I was hoping that you could atleast match amount figure, then I'd be very happy. <br/>

**“Why are you switching jobs just after 3 months?”** <br/>

“When I joined Techolution, I was genuinely excited by the role, especially given the mention of Azure-focused DevOps work <br/> during the hiring discussions. However, after joining, I realized the actual work is quite limited in scope — mostly <br/> operational support, without exposure to scalable CI/CD architecture, cloud-native tooling, or infrastructure <br/>automation — which are the areas I've been consistently working on and want to grow further in.” <br/>

“Rather than staying too long in a role that doesn't align with my long-term technical goals, I decided it's better to <br/> realign early. I see Deloitte as a much better fit — especially for enterprise-grade Azure DevOps work at scale, and I’m <br/> confident I can contribute meaningfully from day one.” <br/>

“This is the only early move in my career. My previous stints — 2.5 years at HCL and 1.6 at TCS — show my preference for stability and consistent growth.” <br/>

🧭 **If they press further on "Why not stay longer?"** <br/>

“I believe that if something clearly doesn’t align with your core strengths and future path, it’s better to act early — <br/> respectfully and professionally — rather than wait too long and become disconnected or disengaged. I want to stay hands-on in building, automating, and scaling Azure DevOps systems, and this opportunity gives me that.” <br/>
