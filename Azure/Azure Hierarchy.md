â€¢ Azure resource hierarchy is the way resources and services are organized within Microsoft Azure. <br/>
â€¢ It provides a logical structure for managing, accessing, and controlling cloud resources. <br/>
â€¢ The hierarchy consists of four key levels: <br/>
-- **Management Groups, Subscriptions, Resource Groups, and Resources.** <br/>

â€¢ **Azure Active Directory (AAD)**, now called **Microsoft Entra ID**, is Microsoftâ€™s **cloud-based identity and access management** service. <br/>
  It helps secure and manage user identities, authentication, and access to resources in Azure, Microsoft 365, and other cloud apps. <br/>
  
â€¢ In Azure, **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** is the feature used to **manage who has access to Azure resources**, what they can do, and what areas they can access. <br/>
It works by assigning **roles to users, groups, or service principals using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** at the **resource, resource group, or subscription level.** <br/>

1) **ðŸ”¹ Azure Tenant?** <br/>

- An **Azure tenant** is a dedicated instance of Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) that stores and manages <br/>
  your organization's users, groups, and access to Azure services. <br/>
- It is uniquely identified by a domain like yourcompany.onmicrosoft.com. <br/>
- Itâ€™s where all users, groups, service principals, and identities are created. <br/>

-- All RBAC permissions, policy assignments, and Azure login/authentication start here. <br/>
-- Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Conditional Access policies are enforced here. <br/>

2) **ðŸ”¹ Management Groups** <br/>

- Management Groups are used to organize multiple Azure subscriptions under a common structure. <br/>
- They allow you to group multiple subscriptions under one umbrella, making it easier to apply policies and manage permissions across all subscriptions. <br/>

- Management groups can have **child management groups** or **subscriptions.** <br/>
- You can apply **Azure Policies** or **RBAC roles** at the **management group level,** and they inherit downward. <br/>

3) **ðŸ”¹ Azure Subscription** <br/>
- An **Azure subscription** is a container that holds a **set of Azure resources** and is used to manage billing, access, and resource usage. It is linked to an Azure tenant and enables you to deploy and organize services under one account. <br/>
-  Every Azure resource lives inside exactly one subscription. <br/>
- Subscriptions allow environment separation (e.g., Dev vs Prod), cost tracking, and access scoping. <br/>

**âœ… Common real-world scenario:** <br/>
Dev Team works in Dev-Sub <br/>
Prod Team only gets access to Prod-Sub <br/>

- You can create **multiple subscriptions** inside a tenant or using one Azure account, and there are some limits/Quotas assigned to each subscription. <br/>
- All the subscriptions are attached to the globally unique ID called Subscription ID <br/>
