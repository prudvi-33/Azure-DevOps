ðŸ”¹ **Microsoft Hosted Agents:** <br/>

This is a service totally managed by microsoft and it's cleared on every execution of pipeline (on each pipeline execution). <br/>  

âž¤ With Microsoft-hosted agents, **maintenance and upgrades are taken care of** for you. <br/>
âž¤ You always get the **latest version of the VM image** you specify in your pipeline.<br/>
âž¤ **Each time you run a pipeline, you get a fresh virtual machine for each job in the pipeline**. <br/>
âž¤ The virtual machine is discarded after one job (which means any change that a job makes to the virtual machine file system, such as checking out code, will be unavailable to the next job). <br/>
âž¤ Microsoft-hosted agents can run jobs directly on the VM or in a container. <br/> <br/>

âž¤ **Azure Pipelines** provides a **predefined agent pool** named **Azure Pipelines** with **Microsoft-hosted agents**. <br/>

ðŸ”¸ **Self Hosted Agents** <br/>
