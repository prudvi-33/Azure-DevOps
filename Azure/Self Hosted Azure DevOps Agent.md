ðŸ”¹ **Microsoft Hosted Agents:** <br/>

This is a service totally managed by microsoft and it's cleared on every execution of pipeline (on each pipeline execution). <br/>  

âž¤ With Microsoft-hosted agents, **maintenance and upgrades are taken care of** for you. <br/>
âž¤ You always get the **latest version of the VM image** you specify in your pipeline.<br/>
âž¤ **Each time you run a pipeline, you get a fresh virtual machine for each job in the pipeline**. <br/>
âž¤ The virtual machine is discarded after one job (which means any change that a job makes to the virtual machine file system, such as checking out code, will be unavailable to the next job). <br/>
âž¤ Microsoft-hosted agents can run jobs directly on the VM or in a container. <br/> <br/>

âž¤ **Azure Pipelines** provides a **predefined agent pool** named **Azure Pipelines** with **Microsoft-hosted agents**. <br/>

âž¤ Microsoft-hosted agents that run Windows and Linux images are provisioned on Azure general purpose virtual machines with a 2 core CPU, 7 GB of RAM, and 14 GB of SSD disk space. <br/>

ðŸ”¸ **Self Hosted Agents** <br/>

âž¤ This is a service that you can to setup and manage by yourself. This can be custom Virtual machine on Azure or on-premise machine inside ur infrastructure. <br/>
âž¤ In a self hosted agent, you can install all the software you need for ur builds, and this is persisted on every pipeline execution. <br/>
âž¤ A self-hosted agent can be Windows, Linux, Mac OS or in a Docker container. <br/>

**Prerequisites:** <br/>

âž¤ Azure Accpunt with active subscription. <br/>
âž¤ Create a Ubuntu VM in Azure Cloud (under Virtual Machines Resource). <br/>
âž¤ Create Personal Access Token in Azure DevOps. <br/>

Login to your **Azure VM** now. <br/>
âž¥ As you have Linux VM, try to ssh into it, using Cloud shell. <br/>
âž¥ ssh "username"@"IP", then it will prompt u to enter pwd(If u choose as pwd, while VM creation) <br/>
âž¥ Once you enter pwd and click enter, U will be successfully logged into VM. <br/>

**Now Process of installing Agent inside VM in Steps**,  <br/>

**Pre-requisite:** <br/>
Install the libs, dependencies needed for the Agent installation. <br/>

  **sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y unzip curl wget** <br/>
  
**Step #1** - Create the Agent <br/>
       mkdir myagent && cd myagent <br/>
