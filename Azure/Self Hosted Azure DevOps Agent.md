üîπ **Microsoft Hosted Agents:** <br/>

This is a service totally managed by microsoft and it's cleared on every execution of pipeline (on each pipeline execution). <br/>  

‚û§ With Microsoft-hosted agents, **maintenance and upgrades are taken care of** for you. <br/>
‚û§ You always get the **latest version of the VM image** you specify in your pipeline.<br/>
‚û§ **Each time you run a pipeline, you get a fresh virtual machine for each job in the pipeline**. <br/>
‚û§ The virtual machine is discarded after one job (which means any change that a job makes to the virtual machine file system, such as checking out code, will be unavailable to the next job). <br/>
‚û§ Microsoft-hosted agents can run jobs directly on the VM or in a container. <br/> <br/>

‚û§ **Azure Pipelines** provides a **predefined agent pool** named **Azure Pipelines** with **Microsoft-hosted agents**. <br/>

‚û§ Microsoft-hosted agents that run Windows and Linux images are provisioned on Azure general purpose virtual machines with a 2 core CPU, 7 GB of RAM, and 14 GB of SSD disk space. <br/>

üî∏ **Self Hosted Agents** <br/>

‚û§ This is a service that you can to setup and manage by yourself. This can be custom Virtual machine on Azure or on-premise machine inside ur infrastructure. <br/>
‚û§ In a self hosted agent, you can install all the software you need for ur builds, and this is persisted on every pipeline execution. <br/>
‚û§ A self-hosted agent can be Windows, Linux, Mac OS or in a Docker container. <br/>

**Prerequisites:** <br/>

‚û§ Azure Accpunt with active subscription. <br/>
‚û§ Create a Ubuntu VM in Azure Cloud (under Virtual Machines Resource). <br/>
‚û§ Create Personal Access Token in Azure DevOps. <br/>

Note down the steps to configure Linux build agent. <br/>
Login to your **Azure VM** now. <br/>
‚û• As you have Linux VM, try to ssh into it, using Cloud shell. <br/>
‚û• ssh "username"@"IP", then it will prompt u to enter pwd(If u choose as pwd, while VM creation) <br/>
‚û• Once you enter pwd and click enter, U will be successfully logged into VM. <br/>
