* In Azure, every **Resource Group** is tied to exactly **one Subscription** <br/>

‚úÖ **Key Relationship** <br/>

**Subscription** ‚Üí contains Resource Groups <br/>
**Resource Group** ‚Üí contains Resources (VMs, NSGs, Storage, etc.) <br/>

* **‚úÖ Resource Providers in Azure?** <br/>

In Azure, a **resource provider** is a service that supplies resources you can deploy and manage ‚Äî like VMs, storage accounts, AKS clusters, etc. <br/>

Each resource type (e.g., Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines, Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts) comes from a resource provider, like: <br/>

üõ†Ô∏è **Why You Might Need to Enable Them** <br/>
If you try to deploy a resource and the provider isn‚Äôt registered for your subscription, Azure will throw an error like: <br/>

**"The subscription is not registered to use namespace 'Microsoft.XXX'"** <br/>

That‚Äôs when you enable/register the provider. <br/>

You enable a provider (aka register it) when you‚Äôre deploying a type of resource for the first time and Azure needs permission to allow it under your subscription. <br/>
