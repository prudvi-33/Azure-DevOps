🔐 **What is Private Link in Azure?** <br/>
Azure Private Link allows you to securely access Azure services (like Blob Storage, SQL Database, Web Apps) or your own services <br/>
over a private IP address within your virtual network (VNet). <br/>

📍 **What is a Private Endpoint?** <br/>
A Private Endpoint is the actual network interface in your VNet that uses a private IP address to connect to an Azure service <br/>
via Private Link. <br/>

**Private Link** - Enables private connectivity to Azure services. <br/>
**Private Endpoint** - A private IP address in your VNet that connects you privately to the service. <br/>

🔧 **Scenario:** <br/>
You have a storage account and want your VM in a VNet to access it securely without going over the internet. <br/>


🔍 **Example DNS:**
Before: <br/>
myaccount.blob.core.windows.net → Public IP <br/>

**After Private Endpoint:** <br/>
myaccount.blob.core.windows.net → Private IP (e.g., 10.1.0.5) <br/>

✅ **Azure AD Groups (Active Directory Groups):** <br/>
   These are collections of users, service principals, or other groups. <br/>
   Used to manage access and permissions more efficiently. <br/>

**🔄 Relationship:** <br/>
You assign roles, apps, or policies to an Azure AD group — this is a group assignment.    <br/>

**🔧 Step-by-Step Breakdown** <br/>
**1. Create Azure AD Groups** <br/>
You create two AD security groups: <br/>

DevOps-Team  <br/>
Developers-Team <br/>

**In Azure AD, groups like this are typically used to:** <br/>
Assign RBAC roles (e.g., Contributor) to a set of users. <br/>
Control access to resources like subscriptions, resource groups, or specific services. <br/>

**And add users:** <br/>

DevOps-Team ➜ devops.user@company.com <br/>
Developers-Team ➜ developer.user@company.com <br/>

**2. Choose Roles** <br/>
You decide what roles are needed: <br/>

DevOps-Team ➜ Contributor role (can manage all resources) <br/>
Developers-Team ➜ Reader role (can only view resources) <br/>

**3. Assign Roles to Groups (RBAC)** <br/>
Go to DevResourceGroup in Azure Portal, then: <br/>

Assign Contributor role to DevOps-Team <br/>
Assign Reader role to Developers-Team <br/>

This is the group assignment part... <br/>

=========================================================================

**Group Ownership vs Group Membership** <br/>

**Owners** manage the group (add/remove members, change settings). <br/>
**Members** are the ones affected by role assignments when the group is assigned a role. <br/>
An Owner is not automatically a Member — unless explicitly added. <br/>
