**Azure AD** isn‚Äôt just for users ‚Äî it also manages applications that need to authenticate and access resources. <br/>

**Application Registration(App Registration)?** <br/>

- Application Registration refers to the process of registering an application with Azure Entra ID. <br/>
- This is typically done when you‚Äôre developing or integrating an application that must **securely interact with Azure services** or other Microsoft services. <br/>

- When you register an application, Azure assigns it a unique Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID. <br/>
- After successful registration of your app, you will notice the app is created in 2 places ‚Äî **‚ÄúApp Registrations‚Äù** and <br/> **‚ÄúEnterprise applications‚Äù**. It created a **globally unique identifier Application (client) ID** in **Application Registration** and a <br/> **local Service Principal Object** with the **same name** in the **Enterprise Application**. <br/>

- Apps under **‚ÄúApp Registrations‚Äù** represent the actual application object. <br/>

- This is the place where you **set the authentication and authorization requirements of your app.** <br/>

-- **Certificates and Secrets:** You can generate client secrets or upload certificates for authentication.
   Your app will pass credentials, i.e. either via a client secret or a certificate to Azure AD to prove its identity, and therefore request tokens <br/>
-- **Redirect URIs:** Specify the URLs where Azure AD redirects users after authentication. <br/>

**When to Use Application Registration?** <br/>
**Developing Custom Applications:** You‚Äôre building a web, mobile, or desktop application that needs secure access to Azure resources or Microsoft APIs. <br/>

=========================================================================================================================

**Enterprise Application**  <br/>
- An Enterprise App with the same name is automatically created once you register an application. <br/>

- The configurations that you have set for your app under App Registrations are referenced by your Enterprise Application. <br/>
